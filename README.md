# Chat_SugarCRM

The official documentation produced for the SugarCRM is not great. As a result this script creates a vector store of the mysql tables (columns, primary/foreign keys) derived from the online xml of the Sugar schema. This allows people to ask questions about the schema, including how best to join tables, which has proved useful for new data analysts & devs in the business. I have also created a similar process for all of the REST API documentation
