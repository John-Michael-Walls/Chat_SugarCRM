# Chat_SugarCRM

The official documentation produced for the SugarCRM isnt always optimal. As a result this script creates a vector store of details of the mysql tables (columns, primary/foreign keys) derived from the online xml of the Sugar schema. This creates a sugar chatbot that allows people to ask questions about the schema, including how best to join tables, which has proved useful for new data analysts & devs in the business. I have also created a similar process for all of the REST API documentation which i can upload if there is any demand
